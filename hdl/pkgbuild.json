You can have more than one program on a disc, just put them in different directories (subdirectories are allowed too). The program will display a menu with all programs on the disc. Add meta.xml (HBC-format) to the directories for friendly program names and descriptions.\n\t\nAuthor:\nSierradev (projects@sierradev.org) - www.sierradev.org\n\nThanks to: shagkur (DOL loading), joedj (pointing out ISO9660 devoptab), Duhow (betatester) and everyone on #wiidev!"
