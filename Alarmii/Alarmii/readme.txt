1) ABOUT
---------

 This is my first Wii program.  It is a timer/alarm clock.

 Features:
  Alarm clock
  Countdown timer
  Interval alerts
  Customizable sound samples (keep them small as SD card loading is a little slow)
  Audio and Visual alerts
  + more


 This program is provided *free of charge*. It may NOT be included in any products which carry a charge.
 Please only link to the original download: www.tribine.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/blitter/

 Disclaimer: You agree to use this program at your own risk.  I will NOT be held responsible
             for any damage it may cause, or if it does not function correctly.



-----------
2) INSTALL
-----------

 Copy this folder to your SD card inside the "apps" folder, and run with The HomeBrew Channel.

 If you want to use custom sound samples:
  use ".raw" format, 8000 Hz, 8 bit signed, mono - try "WavePad" to convert .wav files (etc)
  (remember to keep them small, unless you can wait for the Wii's SD to load!)


---------
3) USAGE
---------

 Use any wiimote to adjust the numbers.  Click on the alarm button to enable/disable

 A........increase number
 B........decrease number
 *note: you will individually adjust hours, minutes, or seconds. (they will not effect each other)

 Home.....exit program


 Whichever number you click on will be the active mode ("set" or "remain") until you enable the alarm.

 Settings/adjustments will be saved automatically when you *exit* the program.

4) CHANGE LOG
--------------

 +++++++++++
 v1.0

  added: auto-load/save settings to SD card (now you don't have to setup every time!)
  added: load sound files from SD card (allowing for custom sound effects - hence, no card = no sound!)
  added: visual cues at interval and alarm
  bug fix: disabled potential rumble on exit screen


 ++++++++++++
 v0.8 (alpha)

  Not really a bug, but adjusting the 'numbers' independantly can be confusing.
  This needs to be more intuitive - However, it really is quite logical!

  PAL50 mode is not vertically centered accordingly (but things all fit of course ;)
