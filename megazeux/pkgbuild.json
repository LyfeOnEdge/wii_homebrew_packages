        "details": "MegaZeux is a Game Creation System (GCS), inspired by\n\tEpic MegaGames' ZZT, first released by Gregory Janson in 1994. It was\n\trecently ported from 16bit MSDOS C/ASM to portable C/C++, improving its\n\tplatform support and hardware compatibility.\n\tMany features have been added since the original DOS version, and with\n\tthe help of an intuitive editor and a simple but powerful\n\tobject-oriented programming language, MegaZeux allows you to create your\n\town ANSI-esque games regardless of genre. It is actively maintained by a\n\tthriving community.\n\tSee http://digitalmzx.net/ for more information."
