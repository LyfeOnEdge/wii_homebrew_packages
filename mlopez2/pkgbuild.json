DESCRIPTION -\n\nMarcos Lopez 2 is a game of instant gratification, made\nfor people who don't like playing video games anymore.\n\nA lot of people complained that Marcos Lopez 1 was too\nshort because of its 3 stages, so I made Marcos Lopez longer.\nThere are now in total 4 stages. Also, if you manage to\nbeat the game, there's a satisfying ending now.\n\nAre you human enough to be Marcos Lopez?\n\n\n- 2. GAME STORY -\n\nYou are a poet and a eternal dreamer. All you want to do\nin your life is to sail the seas and to marry a beautiful girl,\nbut are you willing to pay the high price of having a girl who is not ugly?\n\n\n- 3. CONTROLS -\n\nIn the game, you hold the Wiimote horizontal pad.\n\nLeft : move to the left\nRight : move to the right"
