Or maybe you won't, but then you can always play again.\n\nNew in this version:\n* animation\n* new levels\n* better collision detection\n* did I mention the new levels?\n\nControl the heli with the D-Pad on your primary WiiMote.\n\nThanks a lot to Mr_Nick666, of Wii Double Down fame, for his amazing artwork.\n\nRoxoptr2 is a free game.\n"
