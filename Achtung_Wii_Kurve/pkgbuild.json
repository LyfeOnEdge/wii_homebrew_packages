        "details": "Achtung Wii Kurve is a clone of the computer game Achtung Die Kurve. It differs in that it has alot of customization- and control options and actually includes music and sounds. The game supports up to 12 players.\nThe objective of the game is to survive as long as you can by making sure your curve doesn't hit a wall or another curve.
