Paintown supports user created content through a mod system and user defined functionality through scripting.\n\nPaintown also supports an implementation of M.U.G.E.N. Our goal is to be 100% compatible with M.U.G.E.N 2002.04.14 beta as well as supporting any new updates in the 1.0 version.\n\nPaintown is completely open-source and we would love any contributions in the form of code, art, or donations. Give Paintown a try!\n"
