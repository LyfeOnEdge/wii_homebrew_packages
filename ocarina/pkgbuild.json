Ocarina will try to read these files and apply the cheats to the game.\n\nFor instructions on the PC application, please refer to its readme file!\n\nOn a side note: Ocarina should also be able to boot imports! Please note that you'll need an NTSC capable TV screen to play NTSC games on PAL Wiis and vice versa! RGB cables are not properly supported if you play imports!\n  "
