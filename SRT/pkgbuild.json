        "details": "Shiny Red Tank (working title)\n\nShiny Red Tank is eventually going to become an old-school platformer including elements from my favorite 8-bit and 16-bit games.  It is in very early stages of development and still has quite a few bugs, but you should be able to get a pretty good idea of the game mechanics.\n\nThe game map is currently limited to a test area.  Since I'm horribly slow at making my own graphics, the current graphics are very limited.  Also, I haven't gotten around to implementing sound yet.\n\nSo, in short, this project still has a long way to go.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!\n\n-- MetaFight\n    "
